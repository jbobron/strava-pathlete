TODOS:

-isolate and use passport for authentication to simplify/clean server code
-wireframe
-upgrade to newer version of express and debug bc passport-strava docs uses old version



features:
- pathlete type goals (run across america, climb everest, bike around the world)
  -have a wide list of goals for all levels of users, show users previous goal completed,
   current goal, and mysterious question mark next goal that can be unlocked if current goal
   is complete

- dashboard

  -show calories burned (maybe last 3 days?) to show you how much of a calorie defecit you
   are in and how much you need to eat
  -recovery time: show training load and recovery status (red, yellow, green)
    -determine avg. training load per week (math like comparing trend in stock 52 week avg vs current price )





Questions:
-database? mongo/mongoose?
  -how do you take dev/local db live?
-how do react components get data from express server?
